A twitch bot for moderation and other things. Inspired by Supibot and kunszgbot

I am archiving this repo as I have not been working on this bot in order to focus more on school. I like having a public history of my programming activities, so I am leaving this repo up for anyone to view. My old high school code is fairly messy, but I cared a lot about this project. It helped me learn concepts like how to use NodeJS and SQL, and how to interface with APIs. I might revisit this bot one day in a different programming language, or maybe make a framework like the now deprecated dank-twitch-irc to help others learn programming in the same way I did (though twitch constantly changing their API and IRC rules makes things hard to follow for me right now).
